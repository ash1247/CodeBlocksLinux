Exercises Section 10.4.2
Exercise 10.29: Write a program using stream iterators to read a text file
into a vector of strings.
Exercise 10.30: Use stream iterators, sort, and copy to read a sequence
of integers from the standard input, sort them, and then write them back to
the standard output.
Exercise 10.31: Update the program from the previous exercise so that it
prints only the unique elements. Your program should use unqiue_copy (ยง
10.4.1, p. 403).
Exercise 10.32: Rewrite the bookstore problem from ยง 1.6 (p. 24) using a
vector to hold the transactions and various algorithms to do the processing.
Use sort with your compareIsbn function from ยง 10.3.1 (p. 387) to
arrange the transactions in order, and then use find and accumulate to
do the sum.
Exercise 10.33: Write a program that takes the names of an input file and
two output files. The input file should hold integers. Using an
istream_iterator read the input file. Using ostream_iterators, write
the odd numbers into the first output file. Each value should be followed by a
space. Write the even numbers into the second file. Each of these values
should be placed on a separate line.
